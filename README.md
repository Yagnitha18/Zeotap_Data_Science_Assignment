# Data Science Assignment: eCommerce Transactions Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains the solutions for the eCommerce Transactions Dataset assignment. The assignment involves performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, building a **Lookalike Model**, and implementing **Customer Segmentation** using clustering techniques.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of three CSV files:
- **Customers.csv**: Contains customer details such as ID, name, region, and signup date.
- **Products.csv**: Contains product details such as ID, name, category, and price.
- **Transactions.csv**: Contains transaction details including transaction ID, customer ID, product ID, quantity, and total value.

## Assignment Tasks

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights
- **Objective**: Analyze the dataset and derive at least 5 actionable business insights.
- **Deliverables**:
  - A Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the EDA code.
  - A PDF report summarizing business insights (maximum 500 words).

### Task 2: Lookalike Model
- **Objective**: Build a model to recommend 3 similar customers based on their profile and transaction history.
- **Output**: `Lookalike.csv` mapping each customer to the top 3 lookalikes and their similarity scores for customers C0001 to C0020.
- **Deliverables**:
  - A Jupyter Notebook or Python script explaining the model development.

### Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering
- **Objective**: Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques, incorporating customer profiles and transaction data.
- **Deliverables**:
  - A PDF report on the clustering results, including:
    - Number of clusters formed.
    - DB Index value.
    - Other relevant metrics.
  - A Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the clustering code.
